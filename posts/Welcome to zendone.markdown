Today we are launching the zendone's blog. There is still a lot of work to do, but we think it is about time to start sharing what we are doing with the community.

[zendone](http://www.zendone.com) is a personal productivity tool designed around 3 principles:

1. **Based in [Getting Things Done (GTD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_things_done).** zendone aims to make it easy to implement the GTD workflow.
2. **Using the right tool for the right job.** There are world-class tools for implementing some GTD functions. zendone don't recreate these mechanisms. But it offers a world-class integration instead. In zendone:

	- [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) is both the main collection mechanism and the archive for your reference material
	- [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/) is the GTD Calendar.

3. **Being simple and beautiful.** We believe there is a lot of power in hiding details. And we believe there is a lot of pleasure in using well designed things. zendone reflects this thinking.

We are participating in the [incoming Evernote developers competition](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/competition.php). Here it is our introductory video to zendone:

zendone is currently in alpha state. We plan to launch a private beta soon. If you are interested, you can request an invitation for the beta in [our homepage](http://www.zendone.com). You can also [follow us on twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/zendoneapp).
                                         
And a final comment: while zendone is heavily inspired by GTDÂ®, should not be considered a certified or official GTD implementation. zendone is not endorsed by the [David Allen Company](http://www.davidco.com/), which is the owner of the registered trademarks GTD@ and Getting Things Done@.
