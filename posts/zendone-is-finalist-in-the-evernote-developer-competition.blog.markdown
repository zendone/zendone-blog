We couldn't be happier: zendone has been selected among the 6 finalists in the incoming [Evernote Developer Competition](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/vote.php).

And we have enjoyed the *Evernote effect*. In one day our introductory video has had more than 1,2000 views (in both [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/26333538) and [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-AOfLttbdw)). Our invitations list keeps getting bigger, and it will reach the magic number of 1,000 soon. Being selected has been a gift for us and we are incredibly thankful to [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) for that.

We could have never expected how much people were going to like zendone. Since the publication of our video, people keep telling us in [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/zendoneapp) and [in our blog](http://blog.zendone.com/2011/07/24/welcome-to-zendone/#comments) how much they like our approach to GTD with Evernote and Google Calendar.

Many people told us they have been waiting for something like zendone to appear for a long time. We built zendone for satisfying our needs, so we are excited to see that other people share our point of view. The feedback we are receiving in this initial launching phase make us feel happier that we can express.

And congratulations to the other finalists: [Colorstache](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/colorstache.php), [MyWorld](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/wikitude.php), [Notablemeals](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/notablemeals.php), [Sniptastic!](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/sniptastic.php) and [Touchanote](http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/touchanote.php). They are awesome. We are honored to compete with such talented people.
