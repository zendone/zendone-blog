After watching our [introductory video](http://vimeo.com/26333538), some people asked us about the nature of zendone. Is it a mac-only application? Is there a Windows version? Actually, zendone is not a desktop application. It is a web application. This mean you only need a web browser to run it.

According to the feedback, we obviously should have made it more clear in the video that zendone is a web application. At the same time, we have worked a lot in the way zendone looks and feels, so we feel someway pleased by the confusion.

For example, we like the responsiveness of desktop applications. We like their shortcuts system and the way you select elements in them, using the arrow keys and the SHIFT/CTRL keys consistently. We love to instantly see the contents of any section we click and we expect not having to wait for elements to appear disappear when we act on something. We were sure that the first zendone client was going to be web, but we didn't want to renounce to all this.

But this approach has a prize. You will need a modern javascript-powered browser to run zendone. We currently support modern versions of [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/). [Internet Explorer 9+](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home) will be supported in the future, we just have to figure out why it doesn't work right now :). Internet Explorer 7 and 8 will only be usable with [Google Chrome Frame](http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/). Finally, we'd also like to support [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), since it's a great browser that has traditionally payed a lot of attention to web standards and javascript.
